# Legal Translation Prototype - Development Rules

## Project Mission
Build a minimal viable prototype that demonstrates legal document translation capability to secure the first paying customer within 3-4 weeks.

## Core Principles
1. SPEED OVER PERFECTION: Every decision optimizes for fastest path to customer demo
2. VALIDATION OVER ARCHITECTURE: Build to learn if the client will pay, not to scale
3. SIMPLICITY OVER ELEGANCE: Use the simplest approach that works
4. WORKING OVER COMPREHENSIVE: Feature completeness is irrelevant until there's revenue

## Technical Constraints

### Must Have
- Process 50+ documents in batch
- Maintain terminology consistency across translations
- Preserve document formatting (DOCX in, DOCX out)
- Use Claude API for translations
- Support French/German ↔ English/German
- Run locally or on Heroku
- Complete in 3-4 weeks of part-time work

### Must NOT Have (Initially)
- MCP server implementation
- User authentication system
- Database (use file system)
- Enterprise architecture
- API endpoints for external use
- Advanced workflow engine
- Multi-tenant support
- On-premises deployment option
